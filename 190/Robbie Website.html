                <p>
                    People who use public washing and laundry machines never know if or when a unit will be open. This leads to frustration from many people who go all the way to these units, not knowing that they wouldnâ€™t be able to use them. Our goal is to create a solution to this problem and have a way for people to know whether a washing or laundry machine unit is open before they go to them.
